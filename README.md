# Project: Heart Disease Diagnostic Data Analysis

### Overview

I’m excited to share the completion of my project as a Data Analyst intern at Unified Mentor, where I focused on analyzing heart disease diagnostic data using Python.

### Project Highlights

- **ETL Process**: Efficiently managed heart disease data through a comprehensive Extract-Transform-Load (ETL) process.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Performed detailed analysis using Python, with tools such as Pandas, Seaborn, and Plotly.

### Key Insights

- Visualized the distribution of heart disease across various demographics.
- Identified significant patterns related to age, gender, and chest pain types.
- Employed diverse visualizations, including histograms and box plots, to extract valuable insights.

### Libraries Used

- Python libraries included Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, and Plotly.

### Impact and Future Work

This project enhanced my data analysis capabilities and deepened my understanding of health data. I’m grateful for the mentorship from Unified Mentor and look forward to applying these skills in future data analyst roles.
